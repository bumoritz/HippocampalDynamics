# HippocampalDynamics

This repository contains analysis code for my main PhD project, which is about hippocampal dynamics for associating events across time. It's pretty much work-in-progress. A streamlined and annotated version of the code as well as the data will be made available upon publication of the paper.


# Project overview

Episodic memory is the ability to remember events in their spatial and temporal context. Forming new episodic memories requires associating events across time and is known to depend on the hippocampus. We investigate whether the hippocampus supports this ability by generating neural activity sequences which tile the temporal gap between events to be linked. 


### Part 1 - Hippocampal dynamics during learning, retrieval and generalisation
We record the activity of hundreds of neurons in the hippocampus while mice learn and retrieve associations between temporally separated events. To study how the hippocampus generalizes task rules for learning new stimulus associations, we then let expert mice perform the same conceptual task with different stimuli they were never exposed to before.

### Part 2 - Binding memories onto artificial memory traces
An emerging view is that binding event representations onto hippocampal sequence templates lays the basis for acquiring new episodic memories. We directly test this hypothesis by stimulating an arbitrary hippocampal sequence while mice have new experiences. We analyze whether this imprinted sequence might acquire meaning to the brain by starting to encode the new experience.
